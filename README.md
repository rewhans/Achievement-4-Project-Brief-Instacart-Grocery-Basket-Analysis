# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis 🛒

## Overview

This project represents the culmination of **Achievement 4** in my data analytics training. It centers around performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a real-world dataset made publicly available by [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) (with added fabricated customer data for educational purposes). Using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment with libraries such as `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, I analyzed customer behavior, purchase patterns, and product trends.

### Objective

Instacart is seeking to improve their **targeted marketing strategies**. As a data analyst, my task was to uncover sales patterns and provide actionable insights to inform segmentation and advertising efforts. This involved investigating:

- Busiest shopping times (by day and hour)
- Times of highest spending
- Product popularity across departments
- Patterns in pricing groups
- Behavioral differences among customer segments based on demographics like age, region, and family status

---

## Key Findings

- **Order Volume Peaks:** The highest number of orders occur on weekends, particularly between 10 AM–2 PM.
- **Spending Peaks:** Average order value tends to peak in the evenings (around 5–8 PM), suggesting optimal ad placement timing.
- **Product Popularity:** Produce and dairy consistently rank as the most purchased categories.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clear patterns were identified in ordering habits across different **loyalty levels**, **family statuses**, and **income brackets**.
- **Loyalty Indicators:** High-frequency users show consistent repeat behavior, offering strong candidates for loyalty program incentives.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**
- **pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn**
- **Data cleaning**, **subsetting**, **aggregation**, **visualization**
- **Customer data integration** for segmentation
- **Pickle** files used for efficient data saving

---

## Visualizations

Several types of charts were used to communicate insights, including:

- 📊 Bar charts for order frequency by department
- 📈 Line charts for hourly ordering behavior
- 📉 Histograms for age/income distributions
- 🟣 Scatterplots for customer segmentation (age vs. spend)

## Recommendations

- **Schedule Ads** during slower hours (early mornings, late nights)
- **Segment Campaigns** based on identified customer profiles
- **Leverage Loyalty** by providing personalized recommendations and exclusive offers
- **Expand Promotion** on lesser-purchased departments to improve sales balance
